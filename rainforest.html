			  		<h1>Rainforest QA</h1>
			  		<h4>Product Design Intern, Summer 2017<br>This case study is currently a work in progress!</h4>

			  		<div id="main-content">

			  		<p class="content">During the summer of 2017, I served as a Product Design intern at Rainforest QA, a startup in San Francisco aiming to automate the quality assurance process through crowdsouring and machine learning. Over the course of 11 weeks, I redesigned several key interactions, assisted in building and implementing a new design language, and helped define scalable design processes at Rainforest.</p>

			  		<p class="content t">As a startup, the team at Rainforest was small, and the product team even smaller &mdash; in fact, the design team consisted primarily of my manager and I. As such, we were able to work closely together on design projects; I also collaborated with Product Managers, Customer Success Managers, and Engineers throughout the company.</p>

			  		<h1>The Problem</h1>

			  		<p class="content">My main design work centered around the Settings pages of the Rainforest platform. As an enterprise level quality assurance service, Rainforest was expected to accommodate complex configurations for each individual customer, ranging from which sites a tester should execute tests on to which browsers a customer wanted a test to be executed on.<br><br>

			  		Users reported numerous frustrations in managing these settings &mdash; my primary focus for the internship was to resolve these pain points.</p>

			  		<h1 class="t">Ramping Up</h1>

			  		<p class="content">My first step was to map and understand the ins and outs of the Rainforest platform &mdash; this was my first encounter with the field of quality assurance, and I spent my first couple weeks learning everything I could about QA, as well as all of the variables that factored into the execution of a test on Rainforest, and information on the main personas that engaged with the platform.</p>
