    		Check these links out! I'm currently open to design opportunities and internships for 2018.

    		<br><br><br>

    		Hiya! I'm a second year at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1717731545171536/">UC Berkeley</a>, studying Cognitive Science &amp; Design Innovation. Last summer, I worked as a Product Design Intern at <a href="https://www.rainforestqa.com/">Rainforest QA</a>; at school, I serve as External Vice President for <a href="https://berkeleyinnovation.org/">Berkeley Innovation</a>, and previously I was a visual &amp; web designer at <a href="http://innovativedesign.club/">Innovative Design</a>.<br><br>

    		<!--I am fascinated by the blurring lines between technology and human cognition &mdash; in particular, how recent technological advancements have shaped the way in which communities and identities percieve themselves. I am also interested in expression and identity in the tech industry; recently, I attended <a href="http://outforundergrad.org/tech/">O4U Tech</a>, a wonderful conference where I was able to speak to students and professionals about life and authenticity.<br><br>-->

    		In my free time, I'm off shooting photographs, studying philosophy, sharpening my web design skills, and seeking new spaces to learn and create in. I also adore the beautiful folk singer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FX34TjJe-c">Sufjan Stevens</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2517622/">birds</a> and <a href="https://orionmagazine.org/article/deep-intellect/">octopus</a>, em dashes, and anything written by <a href="http://lithub.com/the-murakami-effect/">Murakami</a>.<br><br>

        If you'd like to connect, ping me at <a href="mailto:hello@liansong.co">hello@liansong.co</a>!

        <br><br>

        P.S. If your company is interested in working with Berkeley Innovation, feel free to reach out to me! We offer a range of partnership opportunities &mdash; from 10-week consultant projects to tech talks and career fairs.
