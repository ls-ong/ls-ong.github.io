              <p>
                  <em>What's your end goal?</em>
                  <br>A totally bizarro 3d project with absolutely <em>no</em> practical application.
                  <br><br><em>What are you working on?</em>
                  <br>Three.js, Blender
                  <br><br><em>What inspires you?</em>
                  <br>Rhizomes, mushrooms, capitalist ruin, anxiety, the fact that vegetarian omega-3 is ridiculously expensive, <a href="https://threejs.org">sample examples</a>.
                  <br><br><em>What are you working towards?</em>
                  <br>I want to develop my voice and personal style as a designer, and I also want to consider the way three dimensions can be used to reconceptualize the way that we typically understand visual design and interfaces.
                  <br><br><em>If you get stuck, what approaches can you try?</em>
                  <br>&mdash; Block out genuinely productive time to learn the fundamentals.
                  <br>&mdash; Make something every (other) day, even if it's not 3d.
                  <br>&mdash; Work out small individual interactions, don't worry about how they come together.
                  <br><br><em>What will you be looking for during our check-ins?</em>
                  <br>&mdash; Week 4: Start something.
                  <br>&mdash; Week 6: Give up on the last thing, most likely.
                  <br>&mdash; Week 8: Do something else.
                  <br>&mdash; Week 10: Throw all 3 of the previous things into 1 poorly conceived jambalaya
