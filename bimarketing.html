	  		<h2>Recruitment</h2>

	  		<p>In building a recognizable brand and message for Berkeley Innovation's Fall 2017 recruitment season, I was lucky to work alongside <a href="https://www.karenchou.design/">Karen Chou</a>, aiming to develop a consistent theme supported by a set of design assets.<br><br>Our goal was to convey a sense of community &mdash; how thinkers, designers, tinkerers of all stripes come together and belong at Berkeley Innovation. This manifested quite literally, with our logo reimagined as a three dimensional space, depicting members interacting and acting in various steps of the design process: ideating, iterating, interviewing.</p>

	  		<p class="caption">Completed Flyer</p>

	  		<p>With the designs that we created for the flyer, I built out a series of vector assets that would be used across our social media channels &mdash; for instance, a cover photo.</p>

	  		<p>These assets were also used on the Fall 2017 Recruitment website, which can be seen live <a href="">here</a>, coded by our Director of Tech, Kim.</p>

        <h2>Showcase</h2>

        <p>I also created a cover photo for Berkeley Innovation's semesterly Showcase event page, a public event meant to show off the efforts of our consultants.</p>

        <p class="caption">I took the picture too!</p>

        <p>There's a lot more to come &mdash; I'm always busy designing for Berkeley Innovation, so stay tuned! Also, if you're interested in partnering with Berkeley Innovation, feel free to reach out!</p>
