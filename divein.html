				<h1>Dive In</h1>

				<div id="main-content">

				<p class="content">This was a short project that I completed for Dive In, a local start up focused on community organization. The goal was to recreate their event portal, where users could connect with and get involved in local volunteering efforts. I rethought the UI/UX of their portal, in order to better encourage user engagement and interaction; my solution made information and registraton more easily accessible. </p>

				<p class="content">Due to the speedy nature of the project, my process was truncated; I rapidly idenified current pain points, created wireframes, and went straight to a mid-fi prototype.</p>

				<h1>Points of Improvement</h1>

				<p class="content t">The original event page was very barebones; nothing egregious, but certainly nothing to write home about. The points that I found most troubling were: </p>

				<ol>

				<li>A lack of structure; the content simply stacked from the top down, providing no obvious entry points for the user.</li>
				<li>Little consistency with regards to font usage, which increased visual clutter and user confusion.</li>
				<li>The static presentation of information, with no room to expand should more information be required.</li>

				</ol>

				<p class="content t">I began by drawing a set of wireframes, aimed at revamping the page:</p>

				<p class="content t">This project wasn't meant to be anything intensive, so from there, I decided to jump straight to creating a mid-fi prototype using Figma.</p>

				<h1>Mid-fi Prototype</h1>

				<p class="content">I decided to maintain the same color scheme and most of the same information as the original event portal, instead focuseing primarily on the placement and layout of information. In particular, I emphasized the "Register" button and provided a clear call to action throughout the page. I also expanded the page to include more detailed information underneath the fold, while keeping the main points clear and accessible above the fold. Notice how a register button persists on the bottom of the page after scrolling down; this is meant to provide an always accessible entry point.</p>
