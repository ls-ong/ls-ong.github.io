  		<h1>Flyers &amp; Logos</h1>
  		<h4>Miscellaneous designs, 2015 - 2017</h4>

  		<div id="main-content">

  		<h1>Women in Computer Science</h1>
  		<br>

  		<img src="assets/stylesheets/images/visual/wcs2.png" class="fly" alt="women in cs" style="margin-left: -40px;"></img><!--

  		--><p class="content fly-p-r">A logo I created for the Women in Computer Science club at UIUC. The inspiration for this design stemmed from a desire to visually portray women as belonging within the CS community. I approached that quite literally with this logo &mdash; the face is between the ‘C’ and the ‘S’ formed by the hair.</p>

  		<h1>Monta Vista Senior Ball</h1>
  		<br>

  		<img src="assets/stylesheets/images/visual/senior ball.jpg" class="fly" alt="senior ball flyer"></img><!--

  		--><p class="content fly-p-r">An informational flyer that doubled as a ticket, handed out to attendees of my high school’s Senior Ball. The skyline at the bottom is the San Francisco skyline, advertising the location of the event — on a cruise ship in the SF bay. The event was wonderful, if you were wondering (I planned it!).</p>

  		<h1>Berkeley Innovation Career Fair</h1>
  		<br>

  		<img src="assets/stylesheets/images/visual/career fairr.jpg" class="fly" alt="career fair flyer"></img><!--

  		--><p class="content fly-p-r">A promotional flyer created for the Berkeley Innovation Design Career Fair, which I planned and organized. Also, obligatory plug &mdash; if you or your company is interested in <a href="https://berkeleyinnovation.org/partner">working with Berkeley Innovation</a>, shoot me an email! We do cool stuff 😅.</p>

  		<h1>CED Undergrad Student Council</h1>
  		<br>

  		<img src="assets/stylesheets/images/visual/ced2.png" class="fly" alt="ced" style="margin-left: -20px;"></img><!--

  		--><p class="content fly-p-r">A set of logos that I created for the CED Undergraduate Student Council at UC Berkeley &mdash; a colored option and a monochrome option. The colors are meant to represent the fields of study that come together under CED, and the monochrome represents common patterns seen in architectural tools.</p>
